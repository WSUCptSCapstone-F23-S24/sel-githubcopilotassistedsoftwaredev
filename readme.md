# SEL - GitHub CoPilot Software Development

## Project summary

With the creation of generative AI tools, specifically GitHub CoPilot, we aim to determine just how helpful these tools can be for software developers.

Our project assumes the form of a comprehensive study aimed at analyzing the transformative potential of recent advancements in AI, with a particular focus on GitHub CoPilot, in revolutionizing the software development process. The primary objective of our study is to assess the efficacy and quality of software development when utilizing GitHub CoPilot as an assisting tool. To accomplish this, we divide our team into one subteam that uses CoPilot and one subteam that uses no generative AI tools. Comparing and contrasting the experiences between these teams will clearly show exactly how effective AI tools can be at assisting software developers.
