## Project Concept

Splitting into pairs, we will complete the same projects with and without github copilot, comparing the following features
 - Time taken to create working software
 - Amount of code created
 - Quality of code created - bugs, edge cases, etc
 - More?

## Organization

This repo will be organized into multiple branches for different projects that are completed as well as whether or not that version of the project utilized github copilot.



Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
