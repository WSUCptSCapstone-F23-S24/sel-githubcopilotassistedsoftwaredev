[Here](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/sel-githubcopilotassistedsoftwaredev/blob/main/readme.md) is a link to the main read me for this project.



## Approach 2 Setup 

Approach 2 requires a PostgreSQL installation. After retrieving the json data files, you must create the properly formatted tables using pgadmin4. After that, uncomment the 'filldatabase.py' script and run it. After completing this, Approach 2 will be able to be run.

Note: This assumes a complete default PostgreSQL installation, with a password as '123'
