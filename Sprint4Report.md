# Sprint 4 Report (01/08/24 - 2/02/2024)

## What's New
 * Two implementations of the Flex, Bison, and ScanType code.
	* Bison
		* Takes either a file name or raw file data.
		* 'Reads' through the given file/data and transforms it into tokens.
		* These tokens are then passed along to the Flex class.
	* Flex
		* Takes tokens from the Bison class.
		* These tokens are processed into a token object that holds data and classifiers.
		* Tokens are classified as different types, like string, boolean, char, etc.
	* ScanType
		* The ScanType structure stores all necessary information about the scanned token.
		* This structure is used differently depending on the type of token.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, our CoPilot team consisted of Joshua Maloy and Jay-Ar Arsenio. Our NoAI team consisted of Joshua Burke and Ryan Luders. We completed the first part of case study 2, which is planned to consist of 7 parts. This leaves us with 2 parts for each upcoming sprint, giving us plenty of opportunities to determine the effectiveness of generative AI in the software development process.


[Here]() is a video showing off what we completed in this second sprint aside from documentation.

## Unfinished Work
Our teams have wrapped up all planned work this sprint, and we intend to begin part 2 of case study 2 promptly.
