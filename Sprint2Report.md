## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, our sub teams swapped roles. The no AI team for sprint 1 was the CoPilot team for sprint 2, and vice versa. Additionally, we elected to use the no AI team's UI to standardize a starting point for both teams. Once again, the no AI team used no generative AI tools, and the CoPilot team employed the assitance of GitHub Copilot. This second case study has given us more valuable information about the effectiveness of GitHub CoPilot in different situations.

## Unfinished Work
This second part of our case study was implementing the back-end of the application. However, instead of using SQL, both teams utilized basic data structures with JSON file formatting. For the next part, we plan to create a database and change the backend to use SQL queries with a database. This is a much more robust and scalable solution. Additionally, this will inform us of how helpful CoPilot can be with SQL statements, both for creating database structures and for querying data.


## Completed Issues
Both teams completed duplicate issues. These issues can be found at the links below. Additionally, the issues are labeled with the team members who completed the issues.

* [NoAI Team](https://github.com/orgs/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/projects/29/views/2)

 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Separating work packages into issues
  * Splitting work between team members
  * Creating almost all issues at the beginning of the sprint
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Better communication
   * More consistent work throughout the sprint
