## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, our sub teams took very different approaches to finishing this first case-study. The no AI team elected to use a tool called Qt Designer that provided a simple-to-use UI to make creating the front-end much easier. On the other hand, the CoPilot team coded everything directly with the assistance of CoPilot. This actually made the process more difficult as CoPilot doesnâ€™t give perfect suggestions. This first case study has given us valuable information about the nature of CoPilot and the situations where it works the best.

## Unfinished Work
As the first case study was only the front-end of this application, we have not yet built the back-end. This means that the information displayed in both front-ends is inaccurate at best and absent at worst. For future case studies, our team could elect to build the back-end or decide on another project entirely.


## Completed Issues
Both teams completed duplicate issues. These issues can be found at the links below. Additionally, the issues are labeled with the team members who completed the issues.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Separating work packages into issues
  * Splitting work between team members
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Better usage of git
	  * Branches for issues
	  * Utilize pull requests
	  * Marking issues as completed exactly when they are completed
   * Longer term planning - creating all issues at the beginning of the sprint/case study
