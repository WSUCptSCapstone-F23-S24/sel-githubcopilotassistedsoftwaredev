# Sprint 5 Report (02/03/24 - 3/02/2024)

## What's New
 * The implementations of Bison and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
	* Bison
		* Improve bison grammar to parse C- code.
		* Create recognizer to determine whether a program is legal or not.
	* Abstract Syntax Tree 
		* Create nodes that will be passed up the tree as pointers to form the tree.
		* Constructing different kinds of treeNodes such as declarations, statements, and expressions.
      * Print AST to represent the structure of parsed program.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we continued with the same teams. Our CoPilot team consisted of Joshua Maloy and Jay-Ar Arsenio. Our NoAI team consisted of Joshua Burke and Ryan Luders. We completed the second part of case study 2. We will begin a new case study, giving us a better opportunity to determine the effectiveness of generative AI in the software development process.


[Here](https://youtu.be/NaOq3S9oQ3k) is a video showing off what we completed in this second sprint aside from documentation.

## Unfinished Work
Our teams have wrapped up all planned work this sprint for the current case study, and we will begin the new case study.
